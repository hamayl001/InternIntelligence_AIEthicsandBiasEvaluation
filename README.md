**🚀 AI Ethics and Bias Evaluation - End-to-End Example**
In an era where AI systems influence decisions across multiple domains, ensuring fairness and ethical behavior is essential. This project presents a comprehensive approach to evaluating and mitigating bias in machine learning models using the UCI Adult Dataset. It demonstrates:

✅ Bias evaluation through demographic parity metrics
✅ Application of Exponentiated Gradient Mitigation for fairness improvement
✅ Performance comparison before and after bias mitigation


**🎯 Key Objectives**

✅ Data Cleaning & Preprocessing: Prepare and transform data for model training.

✅ Model Training & Evaluation: Build a Logistic Regression model and evaluate accuracy.

✅ Fairness Assessment: Analyze metrics across sensitive groups using Fairlearn.

✅ Bias Mitigation: Apply Exponentiated Gradient Mitigation to minimize unfair outcomes.

✅ Recommendations & Documentation: Communicate results and provide ethical insights.

**📊 Dataset Information**

Dataset Name: UCI Adult Dataset (from OpenML)

Objective: Predict whether an individual’s income exceeds $50K/year.

Target Variable: income (Binary: 1 if >50K, 0 otherwise)

Sensitive Attribute: sex (used for fairness evaluation)

**⚙️ Project Workflow**

**📡 Step 1: Data Loading**
Load the UCI Adult dataset via fetch_openml from scikit-learn.

Combine features and target for streamlined preprocessing.

**🧹 Step 2: Data Cleaning & Preprocessing**
Replace missing values (?) with NaN and drop them.

Convert target variable to binary format (1 for >50K, 0 otherwise).

Drop the sex column to prevent direct influence on model predictions.

**📚 Step 3: Train/Test Split**
Split data into 70% training and 30% testing.

Retain sensitive attributes (sex) for post-training evaluation.

**🔁 Step 4: Preprocessing & Model Pipeline**
Apply OneHotEncoder to categorical features.

Scale numeric features using StandardScaler.

Build a pipeline combining preprocessing and Logistic Regression.

**🎯 Step 5: Model Training**
Train the model using training data.

Evaluate initial accuracy on the test set.

**📏 Step 6: Fairness Evaluation**
Use Fairlearn's MetricFrame to assess:

Overall and by-group accuracy.

Demographic Parity Difference & Ratio to analyze group disparities.

**🛠️ Step 7: Bias Mitigation**
Apply Exponentiated Gradient Mitigation with Demographic Parity constraints.

Evaluate and compare accuracy and fairness metrics post-mitigation.

**📝 Step 8: Documentation & Recommendations**
Document key findings and highlight trade-offs between fairness and accuracy.

Provide recommendations for real-world ethical AI deployment.

**📈 Key Metrics & Results**
Metric	                      |	Mitigated       |   Model
Accuracy                      |	High	          |   Slightly Lower
Demographic Parity Difference |	Higher (Biased)	|   Closer to 0
Demographic Parity Ratio      |	Far from 1      | 	Closer to 1

⚡ Trade-off Notice: Fairness improvement may slightly reduce model accuracy. However, it significantly enhances model ethical performance.

**🔥 Bias Mitigation: Key Insights**
Fairness Constraints: Applied Demographic Parity to mitigate bias.

Exponentiated Gradient Mitigation: Improved fairness with minimal accuracy loss.

Recommendations: Fine-tune hyperparameters (eps) and explore alternative mitigation strategies.
