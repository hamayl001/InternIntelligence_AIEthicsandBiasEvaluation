**🚀 AI Ethics and Bias Evaluation - End-to-End Example**
In an era where AI systems influence decisions across multiple domains, ensuring fairness and ethical behavior is essential. This project presents a comprehensive approach to evaluating and mitigating bias in machine learning models using the UCI Adult Dataset. It demonstrates:

✅ Bias evaluation through demographic parity metrics
✅ Application of Exponentiated Gradient Mitigation for fairness improvement
✅ Performance comparison before and after bias mitigation

## 📊 Dataset Information
- **Dataset Name:** [UCI Adult Dataset](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/adult)  
- **Objective:** Predict whether an individual’s income exceeds $50K/year.  
- **Target Variable:** `income` (Binary: `1` if >50K, `0` otherwise)  
- **Sensitive Attribute:** `sex` (used for fairness evaluation)

### 📡 Step 1: Data Loading
- Load the UCI Adult dataset using `fetch_openml` from **scikit-learn**.
- Combine features and target variable for streamlined preprocessing.

### 🧹 Step 2: Data Cleaning & Preprocessing
- Handle missing values (`?`) by replacing them with `NaN` and dropping rows.
- Convert the target variable to binary classification (`1` if >50K, `0` otherwise).
- Drop the `sex` column to prevent direct influence on model predictions.

### 📚 Step 3: Train/Test Split
- Split data into 70% training and 30% testing.
- Retain sensitive attributes (`sex`) for post-training evaluation.

### 🔁 Step 4: Preprocessing & Model Pipeline
- Apply **OneHotEncoder** to categorical features.
- Scale numeric features using **StandardScaler**.
- Build a pipeline combining preprocessing and **Logistic Regression**.

### 🎯 Step 5: Model Training
- Train the model using the training data.
- Evaluate initial accuracy on the test set.

### 📏 Step 6: Fairness Evaluation
- Use **Fairlearn's MetricFrame** to assess:
    - Overall and by-group accuracy.
    - **Demographic Parity Difference & Ratio** to analyze group disparities.

### 🛠️ Step 7: Bias Mitigation
- Apply **Exponentiated Gradient Mitigation** with **Demographic Parity** constraints.
- Evaluate and compare accuracy and fairness metrics post-mitigation.

### 📝 Step 8: Documentation & Recommendations
- Document key findings and highlight trade-offs between fairness and accuracy.
- Provide recommendations for real-world ethical AI deployment.

## 📈 Key Metrics & Results
| Metric                           | Initial Model  | Mitigated Model |
|----------------------------------|----------------|-----------------|
| **Accuracy**                     | High           | Slightly Lower  |
| **Demographic Parity Difference**| Higher (Biased)| Closer to 0     |
| **Demographic Parity Ratio**     | Far from 1     | Closer to 1     |

> ⚡ **Trade-off Notice:** Fairness improvement may slightly reduce model accuracy. However, it significantly enhances model ethical performance.
